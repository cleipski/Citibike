# An Analysis of Citi Bike 
## Revenue forecasting and customer growth potential

## Introduction

Citi Bike (https://www.citibikenyc.com/) is a bike-sharing program in New York City. They operate several hundred stations across mostly Manhattan and Brooklyn where customers can collect bikes and return them to any station after use. 

The customer model currently distinguishes between annual customers (subscribers) and casual customers (1-day and 3-day passes). During the timeframe determined by the pass, the cutomer may take as many rides as desired. The duration of any single ride, however, 
is limited.

At the end of 2016, Citi Bike had approximately 120,000 active annual subscribers and recorded just shy of 14 million rides that year. The total annual revenue eclipsed 40 million USD in 2016.
